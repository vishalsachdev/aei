## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Key Thesis
AI adoption is concentrated geographically and by task type, following historical patterns of technology diffusion but at unprecedented speed. High-income regions and specific economic sectors show disproportionate adoption rates.

### Critical Finding
**Geographic Digital Divide**: AI usage strongly correlates with income levels across countries, potentially exacerbating global economic inequality if productivity gains concentrate in already-rich regions.

## ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

### Automation vs Augmentation Classification

#### Automation Patterns
1. **Directive**: Users delegate complete tasks to Claude
2. **Feedback Loops**: Users automate with iterative feedback

#### Augmentation Patterns
1. **Learning**: Users seek information/explanations
2. **Task Iteration**: Collaborative task development
3. **Validation**: Users seek feedback on their work

### Geographic Analysis Methodology
- **AI Usage Index (AUI)**: Measures over/under-representation relative to working age population
- **Baseline**: 1.0 = proportional usage, >1.0 = over-representation, <1.0 = under-representation
- **Population Base**: Working age population (15-64 years)
- **Minimum Thresholds**: 200 conversations per country, 100 per US state

## ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS

### Productivity Distribution
- **High-adoption economies**: May capture larger productivity gains
- **Risk**: Increased global economic inequality
- **Convergence threat**: May reverse recent decades of growth convergence

### Labor Market Implications
1. **Model Capability Effect**: Expanded automation of tasks → potential displacement
2. **Learning-by-Doing Effect**: Workers adapting to AI workflows → higher wages for adaptable workers
3. **Skill Premium**: Benefits concentrated among workers with high technological adaptability

### Business Deployment Patterns
- **Capability > Cost**: Most-used API tasks tend to cost more, indicating weak price sensitivity
- **Context Dependency**: Data modernization may be bottleneck for complex AI deployments

## DATA AVAILABILITY

### Open Source Components
- Task-level usage patterns (Claude.ai and 1P API)
- O*NET taxonomy mapping
- Collaboration mode breakdowns
- Methodology documentation
- Geographic patterns (Claude.ai only)

### Research Questions Enabled
1. Local labor market consequences of AI adoption
2. Determinants of AI adoption across geographies
3. Cost-per-task role in enterprise deployment
4. Task automation feasibility patterns
5. Worker employment prospect implications

## HISTORICAL CONTEXT

### Technology Adoption Timelines
- **Electricity**: 30+ years to reach farm households after urban adoption
- **Personal Computer**: 20 years (1981 → majority of homes)
- **Internet**: ~5 years to reach AI's current 2-year adoption rates
- **AI**: 40% of US employees using AI at work (2025) vs 20% (2023)

### Pattern Consistency
AI adoption follows historical technology diffusion patterns:
- **Geographic concentration** in early phases
- **Task specialization** in business adoption
- **Accelerated timeline** compared to 20th century technologies

This structured format enables AI agents to quickly locate specific data points, understand methodological frameworks, and analyze economic implications while maintaining the report's analytical rigor.
