            <p class="paragraph-m"><em>For a summary of this research, please see <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/economic-index-geography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this blog post</a>.</em></p>

            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

            <p class="paragraph-m">AI differs from prior technologies in its unprecedented adoption speed. In the US alone, 40% of employees report using AI at work, up from 20% in 2023 two years ago.<sup class="detail-s agate"><strong>1</strong></sup> Such rapid adoption reflects how useful this technology already is for a wide range of applications, its deployability on existing digital infrastructure, and its ease of use—by just typing or speaking—without specialized training. Rapid improvement of frontier AI likely reinforces fast adoption along each of these dimensions.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-m">Historically, new technologies took decades to reach widespread adoption. Electricity took over 30 years to reach farm households after urban electrification. The first mass-market personal computer reached early adopters in 1981, but did not reach the majority of homes in the US for another 20 years. Even the rapidly-adopted internet took around five years to hit adoption rates that AI reached in just two years.<sup class="detail-s agate"><strong>2</strong></sup></p>

            <p class="paragraph-m">Why is this? In short, it takes time for new technologies—even transformative ones—to diffuse throughout the economy, for consumer adoption to become less geographically concentrated, and for firms to restructure business operations to best unlock new technical capabilities. Firm adoption, first for a narrow set of tasks, then for more general purpose applications, is an important way that consequential technologies spread and have transformative economic effects.<sup class="detail-s agate"><strong>3</strong></sup></p>

            <p class="paragraph-m"><strong>In other words, a hallmark of early technological adoption is that it is <em>concentrated</em>—in both a small number of geographic regions and a small number of tasks in firms.</strong> As we document in this report, AI adoption appears to be following a similar pattern in the 21st century, albeit on shorter timelines and with greater intensity than the diffusion of technologies in the 20th century.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-m">To study such patterns of early AI adoption, we extend the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/economic-index">Anthropic Economic Index</a> along two important dimensions, introducing a geographic analysis of Claude.ai conversations and a first-of-its-kind examination of enterprise API use. We show how Claude usage has evolved over time, how adoption patterns differ across regions, and—for the first time—how firms are deploying frontier AI to solve business problems.</p>

            <h3 id="changing-patterns-of-usage-on-claudeai-over-time">Changing patterns of usage on Claude.ai over time</h3>

            <p class="paragraph-m">In the first chapter of this report, we identify notable changes in usage on Claude.ai over the previous eight months, occurring alongside improvements in underlying model capabilities, new product features, and a broadening of the Claude consumer base.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-m"><strong>We find:</strong></p>
            <ul class="paragraph-m">
                <li><strong>Education and science usage shares are on the rise:</strong> While the use of Claude for coding continues to dominate our total sample at 36%, educational tasks surged from 9.3% to 12.4%, and scientific tasks from 6.3% to 7.2%.</li>
                <li><strong>Users are entrusting Claude with more autonomy:</strong> "Directive" conversations, where users delegate complete tasks to Claude, jumped from 27% to 39%. We see increased program creation in coding (+4.5pp) and a reduction in debugging (-2.9pp)—suggesting that users might be able to achieve more of their goals in a single exchange.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="the-geography-of-ai-adoption">The geography of AI adoption</h3>

            <p class="paragraph-m">For the first time, we release geographic cuts of Claude.ai usage data across 150+ countries and all U.S. states. To study diffusion patterns, we introduce the Anthropic AI Usage Index (AUI) to measure whether Claude.ai use is over- or underrepresented in an economy relative to its working age population.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-m"><strong>We find:</strong></p>
            <ul class="paragraph-m">
                <li><strong>The AUI strongly correlates with income across countries:</strong> As with previous technologies, we see that AI usage is geographically concentrated. Singapore and Canada are among the highest countries in terms of usage per capita at 4.6x and 2.9x what would be expected based on their population, respectively. In contrast, emerging economies, including Indonesia at 0.36x, India at 0.27x and Nigeria at 0.2x, use Claude less.</li>
                <li><strong>In the U.S., local economy factors shape patterns of use:</strong> DC leads per-capita usage (3.82x population share), but Utah is close behind (3.78x). We see evidence that regional usage patterns reflect distinctive features of the local economy: For example, elevated use for IT in California, for financial services in Florida, and for document editing and career assistance in DC.</li>
                <li><strong>Leading countries have more diverse usage:</strong> Lower-adoption countries tend to see more coding usage, while high-adoption regions show diverse applications across education, science, and business. For example, coding tasks are over half of all usage in India versus roughly a third of all usage globally.</li>
                <li><strong>High-adoption countries show less automated, more augmented use:</strong> After controlling for task mix by country, low AUI countries are more likely to delegate complete tasks (automation), while high-adoption areas tend toward greater learning and human-AI iteration (augmentation).</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="paragraph-m">The uneven geography of early AI adoption raises important questions about economic convergence. Transformative technologies of the late 19th century and the early 20th centuries—widespread electrification, the internal combustion engine, indoor plumbing—not only ushered in the era of modern economic growth but accompanied a large divergence in living standards around the world.<sup class="detail-s agate"><strong>4</strong></sup></p>

            <p class="paragraph-m">If the productivity gains are larger for high-adoption economies, current usage patterns suggest that the benefits of AI may concentrate in already-rich regions—possibly increasing global economic inequality and reversing growth convergence seen in recent decades.<sup class="detail-s agate"><strong>5</strong></sup></p>

            <h3 id="systematic-enterprise-deployment-of-ai">Systematic enterprise deployment of AI</h3>

            <p class="paragraph-m">In the final chapter, we present first-of-its-kind insight on a large fraction of our first-party (1P) API traffic, revealing the tasks companies and developers are using Claude to accomplish. Importantly, API users access Claude programmatically, rather than through a web user interface (as with Claude.ai). This shows how early-adopting businesses are deploying frontier AI capabilities.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-m"><strong>We find:</strong></p>
            <ul class="paragraph-m">
                <li><strong>1P API usage, while similar to Claude.ai use, differs in specialized ways:</strong> Both 1P API usage and Claude.ai usage focus heavily on coding tasks. However, 1P API usage is higher for coding and office/admin tasks, while Claude.ai usage is higher for educational and writing tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>1P API usage is automation dominant:</strong> 77% of business uses involve automation usage patterns, compared to about 50% for Claude.ai users. This reflects the programmatic nature of API usage.</li>
                <li><strong>Capabilities seem to matter more than cost in shaping business deployment:</strong> The most-used tasks in our API data tend to cost more than the less frequent ones. Overall, we find evidence of weak price sensitivity. Model capabilities and the economic value of feasibly automating a given task appears to play a larger role in shaping businesses' usage patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Context constrains sophisticated use:</strong> Our analysis suggests that curating the right context for models will be important for high-impact deployments of AI in complex domains. This implies that for some firms costly data modernization and organizational investments to elicit contextual information may be a bottleneck for AI adoption.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="open-source-data-to-catalyze-independent-research">Open source data to catalyze independent research</h3>

            <p class="paragraph-m">As with previous reports, we have open-sourced the underlying data to support independent research on the economic effects of AI. This comprehensive dataset includes task-level usage patterns for both Claude.ai and 1P API traffic (mapped to the O*NET taxonomy as well as bottom-up categories), collaboration mode breakdowns by task, and detailed documentation of our methodology. At present, geographic usage patterns are only available for Claude.ai traffic.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-m">Key questions we hope this data will help others to investigate include:</p>
            <ul class="paragraph-m">
                <li>What are the local labor market consequences for workers and firms of AI usage &amp; adoption?</li>
                <li>What determines AI adoption across countries and within the US? What can be done to ensure that the benefits of AI do not only accrue to already-rich economies?</li>
                <li>What role, if any, does cost-per-task play in shaping enterprise deployment patterns?</li>
                <li>Why are firms able to automate some tasks and not others? What implications does this have for which types of workers will experience better or worse employment prospects?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

            <p class="paragraph-m">Understanding how AI adoption evolves over time can help predict its economic impacts—from productivity gains to workforce changes. With data spanning from December 2024 and January 2025 (from our first report, 'V1') to February and March 2025 ('V2') to our newest insights from August 2025 ('V3'), we can track how AI usage has shifted over the past eight months as capabilities and product features have improved, new kinds of users have adopted the technology, and uses have become more sophisticated. We view the evidence presented below as suggesting that new product features have enabled new forms of work rather than simply accelerating adoption for existing tasks.</p>

            <h3 id="how-claudeai-usage-for-economic-tasks-has-changed">How Claude.ai usage for economic tasks has changed</h3>

            <h4 id="educational-and-scientific-tasks-continue-their-rise-in-relative-importance">Educational and scientific tasks continue their rise in relative importance</h4>

            <p class="paragraph-m">While computer and mathematical tasks still dominate overall usage at 36%, we are seeing sustained growth in knowledge-intensive fields. Educational Instruction and Library tasks rose from 9% in V1 to 12% in V3. Life, Physical, and Social Science tasks increased from 6% to 7%. Meanwhile, the <em>relative</em> share of Business and Financial Operations tasks fell from 6% to 3%, and Management dropped from 5% to 3%.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-m">This divergence suggests AI usage may be diffusing especially quickly among tasks involving knowledge synthesis and explanation, compared to traditional business operations—possibly because these tasks benefit more from Claude's reasoning capabilities.</p>

            <h4 id="new-capabilities-are-shaping-usage-patterns">New capabilities are shaping usage patterns</h4>

            <p class="paragraph-m">At a more granular level, we document changes in task composition that appear linked to features launched between V2 and V3. For example, searching electronic sources and databases grew substantially (0.03% → 0.49%), likely reflecting our <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/web-search">web search release</a> in March. In addition, we also see a rise in internet-based research tasks (0.003% → 0.27%), which aligns with the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/research">Research</a> mode we released in April.<sup class="detail-s agate"><strong>1</strong></sup></p>

            <p class="paragraph-m">We also see other kinds of changes. Tasks relating to developing instructional materials increased by 1.3pp, growing from a base of 0.2% to 1.5%—a more than 6-fold increase that may reflect growing <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-education-report-how-educators-use-claude">adoption among educators</a>.<sup class="detail-s agate"><strong>2</strong></sup> Creating multimedia documents rose 0.4pp, nearly tripling from 0.16% to 0.55%, potentially driven by continued use of our <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/build-artifacts">Artifacts feature</a> for building traditional and AI-powered apps within Claude.ai.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-m">Interestingly, the share of tasks involving creating new code more than doubled, increasing by 4.5 percentage points (from 4.1% to 8.6%), while debugging and error correction tasks fell by 2.8 percentage points (from 16.1% to 13.3%)—a net 7.4pp shift toward creation over fixing code. This may suggest that models have become increasingly reliable, such that users spend less time fixing problems and more time creating things in a single interaction.<sup class="detail-s agate"><strong>3</strong></sup></p>

            <h4 id="directive-automation-is-accelerating">Directive automation is accelerating</h4>

            <p class="paragraph-m">As in previous reports, we also track not just <em>what</em> people use Claude for but <em>how</em> they collaborate with or delegate to Claude on Claude.ai.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-m">At a high level, we distinguish between <em>automation</em> and <em>augmentation</em> modes of using Claude:</p>

            <p class="paragraph-m"><strong><em>Automation</em></strong> encompasses interaction patterns focused on task completion:</p>
            <ul class="paragraph-m">
                <li><strong>Directive</strong>: Users give Claude a task and it completes it with minimal back-and-forth</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback Loops</strong>: Users automate tasks and provide feedback to Claude as needed</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="paragraph-m"><strong><em>Augmentation</em></strong> focuses on collaborative interaction patterns:</p>
            <ul class="paragraph-m">
                <li><strong>Learning</strong>: Users ask Claude for information or explanations about various topics</li>
                <li><strong>Task Iteration</strong>: Users iterate on tasks collaboratively with Claude</li>
                <li><strong>Validation</strong>: Users ask Claude for feedback on their work</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="paragraph-m">The share of <em>directive</em> conversations sampled from Claude.ai conversations jumped from 27% in V1 in late 2024 to 39% in V3. This increase came primarily at the expense of <em>task iteration</em> and <em>learning</em> interactions, implying a sizable net increase in the share of conversations exhibiting automative patterns of use – a notable increase in just eight months. This is the first report where automation usage exceeds augmentation usage.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-m">One interpretation is that this is a result of increasing model capabilities. As models improve at anticipating user needs and producing high-quality outputs on first attempts, users may need fewer follow-up refinements. The jump in directive usage could also signal growing confidence in delegating complete tasks to AI, a form of learning-by-doing.<sup class="detail-s agate"><strong>4</strong></sup></p>

            <p class="paragraph-m">Whether the growth in directive usage is attributable to improving model capabilities or learning-by-doing could signal very different labor market implications. If more advanced models simply expand the set of automated tasks, then the risk increases that workers performing such tasks will be displaced. However, if instead the rise in directive use reflects learning-by-doing, then workers most able to adapt to new AI-powered workflows are likely to see greater demand and higher wages. In other words, AI may benefit some workers more than others: it may lead to higher wages for those with the greatest ability to adapt to technological change, even as those with lower ability to adapt face job disruption.<sup class="detail-s agate"><strong>5</strong></sup> This will be an important area of inquiry for future research.</p>

            <h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h3>

            <p class="paragraph-m">The V3 data reveals that AI capabilities and adoption are continuing to progress. Knowledge-based tasks, including educational and scientific applications, continue their fast growth rate, and new product features appear to be enabling different types of work rather than just accelerating existing tasks.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-m">Most strikingly, the data point toward increased delegation of tasks to AI systems–perhaps due to some combination of user trust in the technology as well as improvement of underlying model capabilities. This could also be due to changes in the underlying user base. The next chapter of this report for the first time breaks down usage across geography, allowing us to disentangle temporal vs. geographic changes more clearly going forward. We will continue to track these trends closely in future reports.</p>
